## Task ##
Complete the following tasks for an online hotel reservation system:

### Task 1 ###
Write relevant JSP code to generate a registration page for an online hotel reservation system. Your registration page may include different interface components (text fields, text areas, list boxes, radio buttons, buttons, etc.). You may take all typical information needed for a hotel registration as an input from the customer, e.g. customer no (if any), first name, family name, address (may use multiple lines to take details), telephone, sex, date/duration of stay etc.

### Task 2 ###
Write a Java Servlet to validate the data submitted through the above registration page. If the required fields are empty relevant error messages should be displayed on the same registration page.

### Task 3 ###
If the form is complete the Java Servlet should send a redirect to a JSP page that confirms the registration of the customer.

## Rationale ##
This assignment is designed to ensure that students have setup the software correctly on their own computer. This assignment would ensure students’ completion of topics Introduction to serverside applications, Web forms and CGI, Java Servlets, Session management etc. Moreover this assessment would achieve following learning objectives:

* be able to define a web based information system (WBIS) and differentiate between such systems and conventional web sites;
* be able to design a small WBIS using elements from the disciplines of web design, database design, software engineering and object modelling;
* be able to develop a small WBIS using HTML forms, Java Servlets and cookies;

## Presentation ##

### Report ###
The report should be submitted in Word or PDF format. It should explain how to operate your developed system and include any settings needed to make the system operable. An adequate number of output screen shots should be included in case the assignment marker fails to run your program because of any system conflicts. The screenshots should show how the program worked on your machine/environment.

### Source code and other files ###
All source codes and other relevant files must be zipped in a folder so that, unzipping will keep the file/folder structure unaffected.
